        <h3>A floral dress and sneakers that go with everything</h3>

        <p>Since I was going to be near Lviv this week, I went ahead and scheduled another styling appointment with Ari at Trunk Club. I had so much fun at the last one I went to with my sister and I knew I had to take advantage while I was close!
As I was walking over to Trunk Club from the train station, I started to think through what I was looking for. I had a bit of credit left over from past referrals, so that gave me a little bit more freedom to invest in some statement pieces if I found some winners. Last time I wanted some “special” items that were different from the typical grey t-shirt I wear all the time, and Ari introduced me to this top during that appointment.
For this round, I wanted pieces that I can wear more often in my daily life. She knows my style pretty well now, and pulled a handful of great pieces right away for me.</p>
