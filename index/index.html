            <h2>the  ultimate list of best face masks</h2>
            <p class="article">Trust me when I say I’ve got you covered in the realm of detox facials.  After a long day, I can confidently say that you’ll find me at home pouring myself a glass of red wine and enjoying a luxuriously long face mask. There’s something about detox masks that are cathartic, too: out with the bad stuff, in with the good stuff (like yoga, but way easier).  Interested?  Read on, darlin’.  
            The Everyday
            Yes To Tomatoes Detoxifying Mud MaskThe Yes To line always does me well.  This mask is a staple at a super-friendly price point (like $16 friendly), making it tempting to keep an extra one in the shower or even leave one at your S.O.’s house. Tomato is a natural revitalizer and astringent (which means it kills acne-causing bacteria) to remind your pores who’s boss. 
            The Fancy High-Tech Mask
            Dr. Brandt Magnetight Age-DefierThis is a futuristic mask if there ever was one. It’s infused with iron, which is a natural purifier — even the name “Magnetight” sounds like it should be a superpower in Tron. Liberally apply this magnetic formula on your face (Tron voice optional). After 30 minutes, remove with the provided magnet by slowly gliding it over skin — not touching it, but hovering over it.</p>

            <h2>10 memorial day beauty essentials that belong in your beach bag</h2>
            <p class="article">Halcyon beach days are here again! Even though the energy of summertime is about being wild and free and comfortable in your skin, it doesn’t necessarily mean you have to ditch makeup and hair altogether. But paring down and perfecting your seaside-beauty routine means less distractions from what really matters: soaking up some sun and good vibrations. To make it easy, here’s everything you need in your beach bag so it’s ready to grab and go at a moment’s notice. Because summer’s calling, and you wouldn’t want to keep it waiting. 
            Juice Beauty SPF 30 Sport SunscreenCome on, you know this: Sunscreen is non-negotiable — in daily life, but especially when you’re half-naked and frolicking on the beach for hours at a time. Physical sunscreens that block UV rays with zinc oxide are your best bet for getting broad-spectrum protection without compromising the health of your skin and body with hormone-disrupting chemicals like oxybenzone and octinoxate.</p>

            <h2>don't get married without these wadding day make-up tips</h2>
            <p class="article">I’ll never forget the last-minute call I got to do a bride’s makeup on the day of her wedding. As I prepped and primed the wife-to-be, she revealed to me that she and her groom had both lost their significant others on 9/11. And that’s not all: Ten minutes later, she whispered, “I have to let you in on a secret. The only people who know this are our lawyers, financial advisers and you: We already ran off and got married! We’re just doing this [wedding] for our families and everyone else.”Cupid may have struck twice, but a clear complexion eluded her.
            For years, the bride was an avid sun worshipper, so her skin was scorched and dull. This, admittedly, gave me a panic attack. I had to figure out a way to fix it immediately. (Ladies, never underestimate the value of a makeup trial.) I ended up applying her foundation with a concealer brush (this is the equivalent of painting an 8 x 10 canvas with a 1 centimeter brush) and mixed foundation with Buxom Divine Goddess Luminizer to give her a luminous look — with full coverage. I was relieved. She was thrilled. Phew. </p>
